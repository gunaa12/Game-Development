# Game-Development

For Harvard's online course on Game Development, I learned the basics of game development through the use of Lua, Love, and Love2D. I learned by remaking some old and iconic games including Pong, Super Mario Bros, Match 3, Flappy Bird, and Breakout.

## Demonstrations

I made videos of me playing the games I recreated on Youtube. Hope you like it!

## To access the code

1) Download the code by pressing on "Code" and then the "Download ZIP" button.
2) Extract the zip file an open the files in an IDE of your choice.
3) You now have full access (in addition to viewing, you can run the code as well) to all of the code.
4) Install Love and Love2D using this link: https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started
5) To run a specific game, select the entire folder and run it with Love2D.
